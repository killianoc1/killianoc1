Hello, my name is Killian O Connell, I am a second year student in TUD Grangegorman.
I study Computer Science Infrastructure (TU857).

I have a strong passion for Coding, Software Development, and through the infrastructure side of my course, Networking and Operating Systems.
So far in my programming career, I have gained skills in C, Python, some assembly and by the end of second year I hope to learn JavaScript.

I hope to publish some projects from my programming career onto this site.
